# Faithfulness gate — impurity double occupancy ⟨n_{d↑}n_{d↓}⟩, the charge-fluctuation static
# property of Krishna-murthy, Wilkins & Wilson II (PRB 21, 1044 (1980)). Evaluated by propagating
# the n↑n↓ observable along the flow and reading ⟨G|n↑n↓|G⟩.
#  (1) U=0 ⇒ the spins are UNCORRELATED, so ⟨n↑n↓⟩ = ⟨n↑⟩⟨n↓⟩ = n_{dσ}² EXACTLY (tier-1: the
#      per-spin occupation is the independently-checked single-particle value of test_occupation).
#  (2) U>0 ⇒ the Coulomb repulsion SUPPRESSES double occupancy below the uncorrelated value,
#      monotonically in U, → 0 as U → ∞ (the local-moment formation of the asymmetric model).
#  (3) bounds: 0 ≤ ⟨n↑n↓⟩ ≤ min(⟨n↑⟩,⟨n↓⟩); honest EngineUnimplemented stub for U1SU2.
